HTML5 QR-code reader - no flash, only html and javascript

A very basic QR-code reader based on:

- jQuery: http://jquery.com/
- QR-code library: https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode

Designed for use with Mobile Safari (iOS 6+), which does not support getUserMedia (as required by Photobooth.js and Say-Cheese)
